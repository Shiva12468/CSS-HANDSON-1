    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheet.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describe HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper,or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="first">CSS is not neccesary</span> <span class="second">CSS save lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web page all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li class="third"><em>External stylesheets are stored in CSS file.</em></li><br>
    </ol><br>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by usinga link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="fourth">in this<br>
            tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier<br>
            for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="fifth">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also <br>special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="sixth">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements ona web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the <br>element.</p>
    <p class="seventh">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
